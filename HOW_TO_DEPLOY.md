# 🚀 How to Deploy - Step by Step

## Choose Your Method:

### ✅ Method 1: Run Locally (Easiest - No Docker Needed)

**Best for:** Testing and development

#### Step 1: Open Terminal 1 (Backend)
```bash
cd "C:\Henok\Co-Worker AI Assistant\backend"
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```
Wait for: "Application startup complete"
Backend runs at: http://localhost:8000

#### Step 2: Open Terminal 2 (Frontend)
```bash
cd "C:\Henok\Co-Worker AI Assistant\frontend"
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```
Wait for: "You can now view your Streamlit app"

#### Step 3: Open Browser
Go to: **http://localhost:8501**

**Done!** Your app is running! 🎉

### ✅ Method 2: Docker (For Production)

**Best for:** Production deployment

#### Step 1: Login to Docker Hub
```bash
docker login
```
- Enter Docker Hub username
- Enter password
- (Sign up at https://hub.docker.com if needed)

#### Step 2: Navigate to Project
```bash
cd "C:\Henok\Co-Worker AI Assistant"
```

#### Step 3: Deploy
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

#### Step 4: Check Status
```bash
docker-compose ps
```

#### Step 5: Open Browser
Go to: **http://localhost:8501**

### ✅ Method 3: Deploy to Cloud (Railway - Easiest)

**Best for:** Sharing with others, production use

#### Step 1: Go to Railway
Visit: https://railway.app
Sign up/Login (free)

#### Step 2: Create New Project
- Click "New Project"
- Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
- Choose: `henokmeron/AI-CoWorker-for-businesses`

#### Step 3: Add Environment Variables
In Railway dashboard, add:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY = your-openai-api-key-here
API_KEY = ai-coworker-secret-key-2024
```

#### Step 4: Deploy
- Railway auto-detects Docker
- Click "Deploy"
- Wait 2-5 minutes

#### Step 5: Get Your URL
Railway gives you a public URL like:
`https://your-app.railway.app`

**Done!** Your app is live on the internet! 🌐

### ✅ Method 4: Deploy to Render (Alternative Cloud)

**Best for:** Alternative to Railway

#### Step 1: Go to Render
Visit: https://render.com
Sign up/Login

#### Step 2: Create Web Service
- Click "New" → "Web Service"
- Connect GitHub repo: `AI-CoWorker-for-businesses`
- Environment: `Docker`
- Dockerfile Path: `backend/Dockerfile`

#### Step 3: Add Environment Variables
Same as Railway:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY = your-openai-api-key-here
API_KEY = ai-coworker-secret-key-2024
```

#### Step 4: Deploy
Click "Create Web Service"
Wait 2-5 minutes

**Done!** Your app is live!

## ⚡ Quick Commands Reference

### Local (No Docker)
```bash
# Terminal 1
cd "C:\Henok\Co-Worker AI Assistant\backend"
python main.py

# Terminal 2

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**"No configuration file provided"**
→ You're in wrong directory. Run: `cd "C:\Henok\Co-Worker AI Assistant"`

**"Authentication required"**
→ Login to Docker: `docker login`

**"Module not found"**
→ Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

**Port already in use**
→ Change ports in docker-compose.yml or stop other services

---

## ✅ What You Need

- ✅ Python 3.11+ installed
- ✅ `.env` file with API key (already done)
- ✅ Code files (already done)
- ✅ Docker (optional, only for Docker method)

**Everything is ready!** Just choose a method above.
